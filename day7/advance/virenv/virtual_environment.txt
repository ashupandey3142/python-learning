What is it?
A virtual environment is a kind of sandbox for Python projects.
It keeps your project dependencies (like libraries and packages) separate from the rest of your computer.

Why use it?
Imagine you're working on two different projects, and they need different versions of the same library. A virtual environment helps you keep them separate.
It prevents conflicts and confusion between different projects.

How to create one?
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to your project folder.
Run: python -m venv myenv (Replace myenv with the name you want for your environment).

How to activate it?
On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
On MacOS/Linux: source myenv/bin/activate
When activated, you'll see the environment name in your terminal prompt.
Installing Packages:

While the environment is active, any Python packages you install (pip install ...) will be specific to that environment.

Deactivating:
When you're done working on your project, just type deactivate in the terminal to leave the virtual environment.

Benefits:
Keeps your project clean and avoids conflicts with other projects.
Easy to share your project with others. They can create their own virtual environment with the same dependencies.
